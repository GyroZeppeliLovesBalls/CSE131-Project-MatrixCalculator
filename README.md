Report 1:
It's 3:45 - 5/11/22, I've submitted 6 out of the 9, and with 5 of them accepted, I believe I'm onto a good start.
What's left is to debug the Determinant function and to try some more test cases with it.
Also, I need to work on the Inverting Algorithm for the Division Function and the documentation of existing functions.
Report is due on 6/4/22, so I think I've got enough time.
